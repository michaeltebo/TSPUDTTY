Stanley, this is me being serious.
In fact, this is my serious room. It's where I come to be serious.
That table is the most serious table I could find. I looked at many, many tables. Hundreds of tables!
It's possible I looked at over a thousand tables, I honestly don't know.
The specific number isn't as important as the understanding that of all the tables that I looked at, this one is the most serious.
I relate this story to impress upon you, the extent to which this is the most serious room I have, which is why I brought you here.
You just tried to open a gamefile, which, of course, runs the risk of breaking the entire game.
You've got no respect for the strict order of scripted narrative events and I just can't have that.
It's time to get serious, Stanley. No jokes, no games.
Outside of this room, I might be more tolerant of those things, but now we're in the room.
Which is why I'm subjecting you to the most serious punishment I can think of: one hundred million-billion-trillion years, standing here in the serious room.
Perhaps after that, we can talk about the severity of your actions, and whether you've learned anything.
But, until then, serious room, GO.""")
